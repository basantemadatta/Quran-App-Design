This file contains the complete, editable Figma source for a fully-featured Quran mobile application designed with spiritual aesthetics, accessibility, and modern UI/UX best practices in mind.

The design includes support for both Day and Night themes, dynamically switching based on the time of day. This ensures a visually comfortable and immersive experience for users whether they're reading at dawn, noon, or night.

# 🧭 Pages Included
This design includes high-fidelity mockups for all key screens in the app:

📖 Quran Page – For reading the Holy Quran with verse highlighting, translations, and audio playback.

📚 Juz & Verse Selector – Allows users to quickly navigate to any juz, surah, or ayah.

🎬 Reels Page – A short-form video section for Quranic inspiration, user-generated reflections, or religious content.

🧭 Compass Page – Built-in Qibla direction feature for prayer alignment.

🗓️ Calendar Page – Islamic calendar view with prayer times, Hijri dates, and upcoming events.

🏠 Main Navigation Page – A hub/home screen that links to all major sections of the app.

🔐 Sign In & Sign Up Pages – For account creation and secure login with clean, accessible design.

🌅 Splash Screen – An animated intro or loading screen with branding.

🤖 Chatbot Page – A smart assistant or AI-based chatbot to help users navigate or ask Quran-related questions.

🫂 Communities Page – A social space for users to join communities, participate in group recitations, or discussions.

☀️🌙 Dual Theme Design
Each page is carefully designed in both day and night modes:

Day Theme: Light backgrounds, dark text, soft golds and greens

Night Theme: Dark backgrounds, glowing accent colors, and warm readability tones

This allows the app to adapt dynamically to user preferences or device time, supporting both comfort and spiritual focus.
